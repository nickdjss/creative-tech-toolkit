Title:
**555 Servo controller**


**Use Case and Warnings:**
A way to control a servo motor using a 555 timer.


**What this circuit does:**
A potentiometer can be used to control the position of the servo by using the following circuit. It produces a positive pulse between about 0.9 milliseconds and 2.1 milliseconds. The off period between pulses is about 40 milliseconds. This can be shortened by reducing the value of the 3M3 resistor.
